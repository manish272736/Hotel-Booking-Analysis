# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## About the Dataset
This dataset contains **119,390 observations** for a **City Hotel** and a **Resort Hotel**.  
Each observation represents a hotel booking between **1st July 2015** and **31st August 2017**, including bookings that arrived and bookings that were canceled.

---

## Business Problem
City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced **high cancellation rates** in recent years.  
These cancellations lead to:
- Reduced revenue
- Inefficient use of hotel rooms

The primary goal is to **reduce cancellation rates**, improve revenue generation, and provide actionable insights for hotel management.  
This analysis focuses on hotel booking cancellations and other factors affecting business performance.

## Analysis Project Steps
1. Define a **Problem Statement**  
2. Identify the **relevant data** for analysis  
3. **Explore and clean** the data  
4. Perform **data analysis** to extract useful insights  
5. Present findings using **visualizations, reports, or dashboards**

## Assumptions
- No unusual events between 2015 and 2017 significantly impacted the dataset  
- The dataset is relevant for hotel planning and decision-making  
- Hotels are **not currently using any suggested solutions**  
- Booking cancellations are the **major factor affecting revenue**  
- Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked period  
- Customers make reservations and cancellations within the same year
